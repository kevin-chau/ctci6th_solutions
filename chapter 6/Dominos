Dominos:
	8x8 chessboard, opposite cornes cut off.
	31 dominos. Can you cover the board?

Solution:
	There are 32 white squares and 30 black squares.
	Each domino takes 1 white and 1 black space.
	Assume you can tile the board. Then we cover 31 black squares covered
	and 31 white squares covered. This contradicts the number of squares.
	Thus by contradiction, it is impossible to cover the board.
