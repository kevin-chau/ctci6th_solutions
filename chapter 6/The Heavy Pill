The Heavy Pill:
	You are given 20 bottles. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills. 1 Bottle has 1.1 gram pills.
	The bottles may or may not have the same number of pills.
	If you can use an exact scale only once, how do you determine the bottle with heavier pills?

Hints:
	1. what if you assigned a number to each of the bottles
	2. You should probably take pills out of each bottle
Solution:

	Number each bottle 1-20 (use tape and a marker). For bottle 1, put 1 pill on the scale. For bottle 2, put 2 pills.
	For bottle 3, put 3 pills ... for bottle 20, put 20 pills.

	If bottle 1 contains the heavy pills, the scale will read XXX.1 grams.
	If bottle 2 contains the heavy pills, the scale will read XXX.2 grams.
	If bottle 10 contains the heavy pills, then the scale will read XXXX.0 grams.....
	If bottle 11 contains the heavy pills, then the scale will read XXXX.1 grams.....

	Now an equation:
	ex: bottle 9 is the heavy bottle
	weight = 1*(1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+10+11+12+13+14+15+16+17+18+19+20) + 1.1*9

	weight = (20*21/2 - x) + 1.1*x

	weight = 210 - x + 1.1x

	weight - 210 = .1x
	x = (weight - 210) * 10
